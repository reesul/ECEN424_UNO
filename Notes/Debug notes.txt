Seems that the queues on either side of the connection are having a problem with reading from themselves
	The dirty trick of adding a delay did nothing for me
	
	I think the solution is to have a queue that the server's main only reads from, and it should also only put into the client's thread
	
Yep, having unidirectional queues fixed the issue as I suspected
	 client side seems robust enough to incorrect format for cards and cards not in their hand, even though all of those checks are done server-side
	 client-server connection seems to be correct so far with very basic inputs, going to try combining the game rules with the client-server implementation
	 
Debugging some small gameplay issues, most are straightforward to fix
		for some reason, I was able to play a D2 when the actual value was 2
		**seems to be working pretty well, but having some problems with wild cards at the moment
		
		direction of gameplay seems to be correct amid skips and draws
		
		
Seems to be some problems with skips and card drawing (none good in hand)


All is well, I am not finding any more issues that are game breaking, though I am sure that some exist
	client input is robust to typos, and allows lower case to be used
