This file is to describe the format to expect for messages across the socket communication

The server will include a boundary at the start and end of the message, just as a way to make sure we are getting the right messages
	This is just two dashes; it will be in a file Const.java that can be referenced otherwise
	To get the message content, do
		'String content = message.split(Const.boundary)[1];'
		
A delimiter is used to separate the game state from the player specific part
	delimiter is '***', and is in Const file just like boundary
	game state comes first, includes the last card played and the current player's turn
		Pull the current player number from the message, if it matches the player's number, then it is their turn, and the scanner should be opened
			I may have something explicit added to the message as well to let player know if it is their turn; we can discuss this
	player's hand comes next
		This should be in the format of cards, |Color,Value| 
			look at Card class to get better understanding
		player's hand should be printed, but if it the hand is larger than some number (say 10), then split it up across multiple lines
	
When a player has won, a message is sent to tell who that winner was
	after this arrives, the socket will be closed
